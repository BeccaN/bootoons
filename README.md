* link to backend api
* run rails migrate and rails seed


to do/stretch:
* create 'selected comic' event
* make categories creatable too
* make comic image an upload from computer
* create category search/filter
* add comments/reactions (perhaps emoji reactions?)
* comicCon contents are jumbled/random (each reload of the page, the comics are randomized)
* create a 'random comic button'
* make the 'New Comic' form stagnant on scrolling
* make each comic editable
* ULTRA STRETCH: make a comic "series" aspect to the app, comics are part of a series that users are creating together.
