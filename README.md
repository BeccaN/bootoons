* link to backend api
* run rails migrate and rails seed

to do/stretch:

* implement 'category filter' search functionality
* comicCon contents are jumbled/random (each reload of the page, the comics are randomized)

* change placeholder text color to something more obvious
* fix image fill in more comic info section
* set max height on more comic info img

* make categories creatable too
* error display/validations

Stretch:
* make comic image an upload from computer
* add 'likes' badge/attribute to comics
* add comments/reactions (perhaps emoji reactions?)
* make each comic editable
* ULTRA STRETCH: make a comic "series" aspect to the app, comics are part of a series that users are creating together.
